# Brief Synopsis
 Working off the codebase of a previously completed project. The goal for this project was to refactor the existing code to be more efficient. Many aspects of the existing code came in a non working condition such as search functionality and image display. Once the eixsting code is in a fixed and working condition it is our job to process the data to run off a web API instead of locally, Add SASS functionality to the existing CSS also to improve usability and performance as well as adding additional features such as:
* A customizable pantry 
* An additional 'to cook' page and button on each recipe
* Improve search functionality


# Learning Goals
* Improve on test based development
* Learn spies testing
* Improve upon existing CSS code using SASS and mixins
* Refactoring skills using existing code to make efficient and small functions throughout
